KubeSphere DevOps offers a series of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) tools, enabling the automation of processes between IT and software development teams.
In CI/CD workflows, every integration is validated through automated builds, encompassing coding, deployment, and testing. This helps developers identify integration errors early, allowing teams to rapidly, securely, and reliably deliver internal software to production environments.
The system supports source code management tools like GitHub, Git, and SVN.
Users can construct CI/CD pipelines via a graphical editing panel (Jenkinsfile out of SCM) or create Jenkinsfile-based pipelines from code repositories (Jenkinsfile in SCM).

KubeSphere DevOps provides the following functionalities:

1. Independent DevOps projects offering controlled access to CI/CD pipelines.
2. Out-of-the-box DevOps capabilities requiring no complex Jenkins configurations.
3. Jenkinsfile-based pipelines offering consistent user experiences, supporting multiple code repositories.
4. Graphical editing panel for pipeline creation, with low learning curve.
5. Robust tool integration mechanisms, such as SonarQube, for code quality checks.
6. Continuous delivery capabilities based on ArgoCD, automating deployments across multi-cluster environments.
